# Introduction to Machine learning with Python
This is a repository is based on the exercises of the book Introduction to Machine Learning using Python a guide for data scientists, when I started the book, I found out that the library used on this book (mglearn) is deprecated. <br>
There is a minor improvement that is translating all to pandas instead of using numpy.
